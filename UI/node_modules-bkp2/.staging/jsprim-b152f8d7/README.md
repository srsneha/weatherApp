# jsprim: utilities for primitive JavaScript types

This module provides miscellaneous facilities for working with strings,
numbers, dates, and objects and arrays of these basic types.


### deepCopy(obj)

Creates a deep copy of a primitive type, object, or array of primitive types.


### deepEqual(obj1, obj2)

Returns whether two objects are equal.


### isEmpty(obj)

Returns true if the given object has no properties and false otherwise.  This
is O(1) (unlike `Object.keys(obj).length === 0`, which is O(N)
