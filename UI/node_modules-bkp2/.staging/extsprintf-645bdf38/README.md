# extsprintf: extended POSIX-style sprintf

Stripped down version of s[n]printf(3c).  We make a best effort to throw an
exception when given a format string we don't understand, rather than ignoring
it, so that we won't break existing programs if/when we go implement the rest
of this.

This implementation currently supports specifying

* field alignment ('-' flag),
* zero-pad ('0' flag)
* always show numeric sign ('+' flag),
* field width
* conversions for strings, decimal integers, and floats (numbers).
