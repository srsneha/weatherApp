An ini format parser and serializer for node.

Sections are treated as nested objects.  Items before the first
heading are saved on the object directly.

## Usage

Consider an ini-file `config.ini` that looks like this:

    ; this comment is being ignored
    scope = global

    [database]
    user = dbuser
    password = dbpassword
    database = use_this_database

    [paths.default]
    datadir = /var/lib/data
    array[] = first value
    array[] = second value
    array[] = third value
